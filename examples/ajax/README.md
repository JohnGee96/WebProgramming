#Overview
Examples using (client-side) JavaScript's `XMLHttpRequest` object:
* `whereintheworld.html` - Uses `XMLHttpRequest` to get the JSON data in file`location.json`.  Upon successful retrieval of `location.json` file, the JSON data is parsed into JavaScript object format which can be used to dynamically update the HTML body via Document Object Model (DOM).
* `redline.html` - After successful loading of the page, an HTTP GET request is made to data a remote server `https://sheltered-forest-5520.herokuapp.com/redline.json` via `XMLHttpRequest`.  Upon receiving a completed response from the server, the JSON data is parsed into JavaScript object format which can be used to dynamically update the HTML body via Document Object Model (DOM).  *IMPORTANT: the resource at https://sheltered-forest-5520.herokuapp.com/redline.json allows cross-origin requests!*
