<h1>COMP 20: Web Programming</h1>
<h2>Fall 2016 Semester Group Project</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You will be working on a team of 4 people maximum to create a prototype pertaining to <span class="def">computer or video games</span>.  Please note that a prototype is different than a product: a product is a complete system with documentation while a prototype simulates most of the complete system.  I do not expect a full-blown product to be completed by the end of the semester.</p>

<h2>Unacceptable Project Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>A blog</li>
<li>A message board</li>
<li>Find the nearest [fill-in-the-blank]</li>
<li>Anything related to payments. Don't go there.</li>
<li>Anything related to the game 2048</li>
</ul>

<h2>Absolute Requirements</h2>
<p>Your team's project must adhere to the following non-negotiable requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Must use HTML5.</li>
<li>Must use JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax.</li>
<li>The team must use <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for the project.  Each team will be provided a private repo in GitHub under the <code>tuftsdev</code> organization.</li>
<li>Must have desktop and mobile web user interfaces.  That is, the user interface is different on the desktop than on mobile.</li>
<li>Must use a server-side framework or technology (e.g., Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails)</li>
<li>Must use least 1 web / RESTful APIs with JSON and/or XML parsing</li>
</ol>

<h2>Pick Four</h2>
<p>On top of the absolute requirements, the project must utilize at least four of the following technologies or ideas (your team's choice):</p>
<ul>
<li>Geolocation</li>
<li>Server-side data persistence (e.g., with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL)</li>
<li>Client-side data persistence with either local storage or web SQL</li>
<li>Front-end framework including Bootstrap, React, Backbone.js, AngularJS</li>
<li>Use of a JavaScript framework for games (e.g., phaser.io, Panda.js, JS Gamepad API)</li>
<li>Reporting with charts and graphs</li>
<li>Send emails, SMSes, or push notifications</li>
<li>Data or screen scraping (good luck with this, not recommended unless you know what you are getting into)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ol>
<li><span class="def">Project proposal and design doc (15 points; <span class="note">due on Tuesday, October 25th</span>)</span>.  In Markdown format, in a <code>README.md</code> file in your team's GitHub repository, using bullet-points:
<ul>
<li>Project title</li>
<li>Problem statement (i.e., what is the problem?)</li>
<li>How do you solve the problem?</li>
<li>List of all the features that your team <span class="stress">will</span> implement (including which of the "Pick 4" items were chosen by the team). Your team will be held accountable for the features you list!</li>
<li>What data will your prototype be using and collecting</li>
<li>Any algorithms or special techniques that will be necessary</li>
<li>Electronic mockups of what your team will be developing using <span class="stress">wireframes</span>.  No hand-drawn mockups accepted.  Tools to create wireframes include <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balsamiq (commercial; de facto standard)</a>, <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/" target="_blank">Gliffy</a>, <a href="http://www.mockflow.com/" target="_blank">MockFlow</a>, and even Microsoft PowerPoint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="def">Project checkup (10 points; <span class="note">due on Tuesday, November 1st</span>)</span> - I will be looking for evidence in your team's private GitHub repository that your team started working on the project.  It does not have to be elaborate.</li>
<li><span class="def">Status report 1 (5 points; <span class="note">due on Friday, November 18th</span>)</span> - This file must be in your team's private GitHub repository, written in either text or Markdown format, that outlines (1) what was accomplished during the week, (2) challenges and issues team faced during the week, and (3) your goals for the next week.</li>
<li><span class="def">Status report 2 (5 points; <span class="note">due on Friday, December 2nd</span>)</span> - Please do not overwrite your status report from the week before.</li>
<li><span class="def">Status report 3 (5 points; <span class="note">due on Friday, December 9th</span>)</span> - Ditto.</li>

<li><span class="def">The completed project (40 points; <span class="note">ABSOLUTE DEADLINE on Tuesday, December 13th at noon</span>)</span></li>
<li><span class="def">Elevator pitch presentation at Semester Group Project Demo Day (10 points; <span class="note">on Tuesday, December 13th at noon at 51 Winthrop Street</span>)</span> - You have less than 5 minutes to explain your project to me and to the judges!</li>
</ol>

<p>The remaining 10 points of the project (out of 100 total points) will be for individual performance on the team based on your teammates' feedback.  That is, underperforming members of a team can receive a lower grade for the final project.</p>

<h2>Example Project Proposal</h2>
<p>Here is <a href="https://github.com/TylerLubeck/comp20-team3">one from spring 2013</a> from Tyler Lubeck, former head TA of the course (fall 2014).  Overall, it is a good proposal but not an excellent proposal: Tyler even made a note of this in the document!  The team did not list the features of the project: "Emails/SMS" was listed but emails and SMSes for what?  A features is what a user can do; a simple example is "user search for song."  The proposal also did not briefly describe the purpose of each API.</p>

<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All works and ideas are owned by the members of the team.  I cannot take ownership of any of your work.  I do not have stake or equity in any project created in my classes for that matter.</p>

<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>I can add to the list of "Pick 4" at any time.</li>
<li>Your team is allowed to change direction or scope of the project but your team will need to submit a new project proposal / design doc and no time extension will be given.</li>
<li>A note on privacy and data collection: the less personal information you collect, the better. Enough said.</li>
<li>Do not do anything with payments. Lots of trouble if you get it wrong (and chances are, you will).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>Your team will be graded on five factors:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="stress">Functionality</span> - Something that works consistently. Remember, a project with fewer features that work is significantly better than one with numerous features, in which some either do not work or are buggy.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Utility</span> - Does your project fulfill a recognized need?  Is it also easy to understand?</li>
<li><span class="stress">Originality</span> - C'mon, another running app or calorie counter?  Better if your team strives to do something more cosmic.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Technical Competency</span> - Use <a href="http://kotaku.com/5975610/the-exceptional-beauty-of-doom-3s-source-code" target="_blank">good programming practices</a>, consistent Git commits and pushes, meaningful Git commit messages used.  Egregious data collecting will be penalized.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Teamwork</span> - Does all team members contribute?  Having one or two people doing all the work is not good.  <span class="note">After the presentations, everyone will conduct a performance review on each teammate!</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the rubric form that will be used on Semester Group Project Demo Day: <a href="semester_group_project_rubric.pdf">semester_group_project_rubric.pdf</a></p>

<h2>Semester Group Project Demo Day</h2>
<p>The room (51 Winthrop Street) will have a number of round tables.  Two teams can share a table to showcase their work.  I will go to each table and each team shall give me a 5 minutes-or-under demo.  Others can walk around and look at other team's work.  The atmosphere will be like a fair.  There will be people outside of this class in attendance, including professors and even trustees of the University.  Please feel free to invite your friends and family to attend.  In the past, students have brought their parents to this event.  Remember, it should not be a stressful day --it is a day to have fun!</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>TBD</p>
